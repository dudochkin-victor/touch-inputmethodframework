Make sure you have a composite manager running. You're mostly OK if you're running Compiz.
If you use Metacity make sure the composite management feature is ON:

gconftool-2 -s -t bool /apps/metacity/general/compositing_manager true

1.
Make sure your dbus session daemon is running. If you're on Scratchbox2,
make sure your session is using the correct DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS environment
variable.

2.
If you're not using duicompositor call meego-im-uiserver with -bypass-wm-hint
You may need to modify the service file as well.

3.
Run your application
Make sure there's no error messages complaining about DBUS service/connection

meego-im-uiserver window is not movable, and if you're using dual screen, it's
always on display 0.0.  You can use Xephyr if you want to move it around.
